# What's this? 
A mod includes console commands to work around in-game bugs/issues for mount and blade 2 bannerlord. 

More content will be added when needed. 

# The command to work around a known issue in-game: 
In version e1.5.6 (probably existing in earlier versions as well), heros/companions would disappear / unavailable to manage. You could see that they are in specific settlement but you couldn't take them back / talk to them. 

For this issue, the command "campaign.add_hero_in_party [heroName]" is added in the mod. 

You can have the hero back in your party using above command to work around the bug. 

# More commands: 
"campaign.sort_troop_in_party" which sorts your troop in the party by type and tier. 

"campaign.marry_me_to [HeroName]" which unblocks you to marry anyone. 

# How to use: 
1. Add the mod in X:\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules (for Steam). 
2. Run the game and load your save. 
3. If cheat mode disabled, enable it by "config.cheat_mode 1". (Alt + ~ to open the console). 
4. Run the command.
